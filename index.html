                 Travelling is my hobby. For a curious person like me ,I like to go to places where i haven't .  Travelling is really adventourous.
        Travelling in nature is like finding who we really are and how big the world is.  Travelling brings me happiness, and makes my day complete. It's 
actually the best method to relax. Inderstanding Mother Nature is the Best Part of education. When you trsvel you automatically learn a new language. It can be hard, but that doesn't mean it's impossible.
